        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 1vw">
          Child poverty in the United Kingdom is an issue that affects a
          significant portion of children. There are about 3.9 million children
          are living in poverty in the country. The consequences of this
          situation can have a detrimental effect on the health, education, and
          overall well-being of affected individuals. Some causes of child
          poverty in the UK include low income, unemployment, and a lack of
          affordable housing. Despite efforts from the government to address
          this issue through various policies such as increasing the minimum
          wage poverty rates remain high and continue to be a concern. It can
          lead people to wonder is enough being done to tackle this issue?
